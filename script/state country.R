"There are so many states and country. The number is too large to make each one
of them a categorical variable. Attempting to reduce the number of states or 
country will also be an arduous task. There are 1094 states and 147 country.
I am afraid we simply can't reduce these numbers by recategorizing without
spending 6 hours on the data."
